    <h3>What is this website?</h3>
    <p>
        While searching for my next job, I got fed up with fake job listings, spammy job boards, and endless scrolling.<br />
        I built this website to help others in Pittsburgh find real job opportunities without that hassle.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I apply for jobs shown on this website?</h3>
    <p>
        Simply browse our listings, click on a job that interests you, and follow the instructions to apply. They should
        link directly to the employer's website.
    </p>

    <h3>I have a job posting I want to share here.</h3>
    <p>
        Simply send us a link to your organization's job opening page via <a href="https://forms.gle/jgGELAmLjfa2GAQX9" target="_blank">this form</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>There is a job posting that I did not approve to appear here.</h3>
    <p>
        Let us know about it in <a href="https://forms.gle/jgGELAmLjfa2GAQX9" target="_blank">this form</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this website free to use?</h3>
    <p>
        ABSOLUTELY YES. Job seekers should NOT be paying money to find a job. Although I can't provide any free job
        training or anything like that, searching for job openings on this website is completely free.
    </p>

    <h3>Who made this website and why?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm just a software developer guy living in Pittsburgh, and I made this website from scratch to delivery on a whim within a day. If you're interested in working with me, feel free to <a href="https://hunj.tech/" target="_blank">contact me</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>This website sucks, lemme help out.</h3>
    <p>
        Hell yeah. You can find this website's repo on GitHub. File an Issue, or hit me up with a Pull Request.
    </p>

    <h3>Do you get paid for this?</h3>
    <p>
        You guys are getting paid?
    </p>
