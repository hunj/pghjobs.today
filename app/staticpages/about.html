            <h3>Why should I use this website?</h3>
            <p>
                While many platforms rely solely on so-called "artificial intelligence" technology to boost their job postings, we take an old-school approach to tackle the digital noise and spam issue in today's job search process: curating jobs manually and providing AI-enhanced insights to enhance your search experience. Here, the term "AI" means love (愛) in Japanese, not some soulless machine learning algorithm.
            </p>

            <h3>How often are new jobs added?</h3>
            <p>
                We update our listings regularly to ensure you have access to the latest hand-picked opportunities. Bookmark us or sign up for alerts to stay in the loop! New features are actively developed at the moment.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I apply for jobs on your site?</h3>
            <p>
                Simply browse our listings, click on a job that interests you, and follow the instructions to apply. Most roles should link directly to the employer's website.
            </p>

            <h3>Is this website free to use?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! Searching for jobs and applying through our site is completely free for job seekers. We’re here to connect you with
                the right opportunities—no strings attached.
            </p>

            <h3>Who made this website and why?</h3>
            <p>
                I'm just another guy who lives in Pittsburgh who recently got laid off. I work as a software engineer, and this is the kind of thing I can easily churn out over a weekend. If you're interested in hiring me, feel free to <a href="https://hunj.dev/" target="_blank">contact me</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>This website sucks, lemme help out.</h3>
            <p>
                Hell yeah. You can find this website's repo on GitHub. File an Issue, or hit me up with a Pull Request.

                    * Disclaimer: A lot of text gibberish paragraphs on this website were generated using ChatGPT which I carefully
                    reviewed and revised. I hope this meaningless wall text helps with the SEO and reach more those who are in desperate
                    need of a job to keep themselves
